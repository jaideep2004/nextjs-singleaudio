Adding all of these advanced, industry-grade features is a significant architectural upgrade. Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown of what needs to be done for each requested feature, followed by a proposed implementation plan for your backend:

1. Extensive Metadata Requirements
Add fields to your track model and validators for:

UPC (Universal Product Code)
PLine (phonogram copyright line)
CLine (copyright line)
Label
Publisher
Explicit lyrics (boolean)
Any other industry metadata (e.g., ISWC, ISNI, language, etc.)

2. Automated Audio Analysis
Integrate with audio analysis libraries/services for:

Loudness measurement (e.g., using ffmpeg, loudness npm package)
Audio quality checks (bitrate, format, duration)
Audio fingerprinting (e.g., AcoustID, Chromaprint, or similar)


3. Territory and Rights Management
Add models and endpoints to:

Define allowed/disallowed territories for each track/release.
Store rights information (e.g., exclusive, non-exclusive).
Validate and enforce rights/territories on upload and distribution.

4. Integration with Third-Party Stores and DSPs via APIs
Add service classes for each store/DSP:

Use APIs (or SFTP/XML if required) to deliver tracks and metadata.
Track delivery status, errors, and confirmations.
Support for store-specific requirements.
5. Advanced Error Handling, Reporting, and Audit Trails
Implement:

Centralized error logging (e.g., Winston, Sentry).
Database audit logs for all critical actions (uploads, edits, deletions, deliveries).
Reporting endpoints and admin UIs for error/audit review.
6. Scalable Cloud-Based Storage and CDN Integration
Migrate file storage to cloud providers:

Use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob for audio/artwork.
Generate signed URLs for secure access.
Integrate with a CDN for global delivery.
7. Sophisticated Workflow for Approvals, Rejections, and Track Versioning
Implement:

Track status transitions (pending, approved, rejected, delivered, etc.).
Allow admins to review, approve, or reject tracks with reasons.
Support for multiple versions of a track (with version history).
Notify users on status changes.
